# Arké Wallet

A native Bitcoin wallet for iPhone that integrates the Ark protocol ([second.tech](https://second.tech)) for enhanced privacy and scalability. Built with SwiftUI and designed for Apple's Liquid Glass design system, Arké provides a user-friendly, devastatingly fashion-forward interface for managing Bitcoin across multiple layers.

> ⚠️ **Signet Only**: Arké currently operates on Bitcoin signet. Mainnet support will be added when the Ark protocol implementation is ready for production use.

## Platform Requirements

- **iOS 26.0 or later** - Required for Liquid Glass design system support
- iPhone only (iPad and macOS are not currently supported)

### A Note on Platform Evolution

Arké began as a macOS application using the Bark CLI tool directly, as Swift bindings weren't initially available for iOS. The codebase still contains macOS code from this earlier phase. The vision evolved toward synchronized iOS and macOS apps, but reliable multi-device wallet synchronization requires protocol-level support that isn't yet available (VTXOs need recovery mechanisms that work across separately-synced devices, and iCloud alone isn't sufficient for this use case).

The current focus is on delivering an excellent iOS experience first. A future macOS version may take one of several approaches: separate wallets per platform, a lightweight companion app that pairs with your iPhone, or full multi-device sync once the underlying protocol supports it. The path forward will become clearer as the Ark ecosystem matures.

- **SwiftData Models**: Transaction history, contacts, tags, and user profiles with CloudKit sync

### Data Flow
1. User interface built with SwiftUI
2. WalletManager coordinates operations
3. BarkWalletFFI handles Ark-specific operations via native Rust bindings
4. BDK handles onchain Bitcoin operations
5. SwiftData persists data locally and syncs via CloudKit
6. Keychain stores sensitive cryptographic material

## Getting Started

### For Users
The easiest way to try Arké is through TestFlight:

1. Visit [arke.cash](https://arke.cash/) and sign up for TestFlight access
2. Install the app on your iPhone (iOS 26.0 or later required)
3. Create a new wallet or import an existing one
4. Start receiving and sending Bitcoin on signet

### For Developers

#### Prerequisites
- macOS 15.0 or later
- Xcode 16.2 or later (for Liquid Glass support)
- iOS 26+ device or simulator

#### Building from Source
1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gbks/arke.git
   cd arke
   ```
2. Open `Arke.xcodeproj` in Xcode
3. Select the iOS target
4. Build and run (⌘R)

#### Project Structure
- `Arké mobile/` - iOS-specific code (primary focus)
- `Shared/` - Shared business logic and data models
- `ArkeUI/` - Reusable UI components package
- `Arké/` - macOS code (currently not maintained)

### Initial Wallet Setup
1. **Create New Wallet**: Generate a new BIP39 mnemonic
2. **Import Wallet**: Restore from existing 12 or 24-word seed phrase
3. **Backup**: Securely store your recovery phrase

Note: Wallet linking across devices is currently disabled but planned for a future release.

## What is Ark?

Ark is a second-layer protocol for Bitcoin that enables:
- **Enhanced Privacy**: Transactions within Ark are more private than standard Bitcoin transactions
- **Instant Payments**: Near-instant settlement between Ark users
- **Scalability**: Reduced blockchain footprint for frequent transactions
- **Self-Custody**: Maintain control of your Bitcoin with unilateral exit capability

Virtual Transaction Outputs (VTXOs) represent your Bitcoin within the Ark network. They can be:
- Transferred instantly to other Ark users
- Exited to onchain Bitcoin at any time
- Automatically refreshed before expiration

Ark was invented in 2023 by Burak, a Bitcoin developer. The protocol is open source and being developed by two independent teams: [Ark Labs](https://arklabs.xyz) and [Second](https://second.tech). Arké is built on Second's implementation, which focuses on Bitcoin payments.

- ✅ Production-ready architecture with FFI and BDK
- ✅ iCloud sync
- ✅ Contact and tag management
- ✅ Lightning Network integration
- ✅ Localization and accessibility
- ✅ Performance optimizations
- ⏳ Broader beta testing with non-technical users
- ⏳ Mainnet support (pending Ark protocol readiness)

## Contributing

While contributions are welcome, there is no proper structure in place to chip in. It's a single-person project at the moment, iterating every day. The biggest help at this time are to provide feedback on any aspect of Arké.

## Privacy & Data

### iCloud Sync
Arké uses CloudKit to sync the following data across your devices:
- Transaction metadata (contacts, tags, notes)
- User profile information
- Wallet configuration and preferences
- Device registry

**What is NOT synced:**
- Your wallet's private keys or seed phrase (always stored locally in Keychain)
- Raw transaction data from the blockchain

You can disable iCloud sync in System Settings if preferred, though this will limit multi-device functionality.

### Data Collection
Arké does not collect analytics, telemetry, or usage data. All wallet operations occur locally or directly with your chosen Ark service provider and Bitcoin nodes.
