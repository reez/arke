# Step 1 Implementation: SwiftData Tag Models

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Created PersistentTag Model (`@Model` class)
- **Purpose**: SwiftData-persistent tag storage
- **Key Features**:
  - Unique UUID identifier
  - Name, color (hex), emoji, creation date, active status
  - Relationship to tag assignments (not direct to transactions)
  - Computed properties for UI convenience (color, display name)
  - Methods to get associated transactions and count

### 2. Created TransactionTagAssignment Model (Junction Table)
- **Purpose**: Many-to-many relationship between tags and transactions
- **Key Benefits**:
  - Better control over relationship lifecycle
  - Easier preservation during server refreshes
  - Extensible for future metadata (assignment date, etc.)
  - Proper cascade deletion behavior

### 3. Updated TransactionModel
- **Added relationship**: `tagAssignments: [TransactionTagAssignment]`
- **Added convenience methods**:
  - `associatedTags`: Get all tags for this transaction
  - `hasTag(_:)`: Check if transaction has specific tag
  - `hasTags`: Check if transaction has any tags
  - `tagCount`: Number of tags on transaction

### 4. Maintained UI Model (TagModel struct)
- **Purpose**: Backward compatibility and UI convenience
- **Features**:
  - Codable struct for serialization
  - Conversion methods to/from PersistentTag
  - Default tag creation functionality
  - Same API as before for existing code

## Architecture Benefits

### Junction Table Approach
Instead of direct `@Relationship` arrays between tags and transactions, we use `TransactionTagAssignment` objects. This provides:
- **Data Integrity**: Easier to maintain during server refreshes
- **Future Extensibility**: Can add metadata like assignment timestamps
- **Clear Ownership**: Explicit control over relationship lifecycle
- **Performance**: Better query control and indexing options

### Two-Model System
- **PersistentTag**: SwiftData model for persistence
- **TagModel**: UI model for interface and serialization
- **Clean Separation**: Persistence logic separate from UI concerns
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code can continue using TagModel

### Relationship Design
```
PersistentTag ←→ TransactionTagAssignment ←→ TransactionModel
     ↑                    ↑                        ↑
   1:many             junction table            1:many
```

## Next Steps (Step 2)

Now that the data models are established, the next step will be:
1. Create `TagService` class following the existing service pattern
2. Implement CRUD operations for tags
3. Add tag assignment/unassignment functionality
4. Integrate with the existing service architecture

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified:
- `TagModel.swift`: Added SwiftData models alongside UI model
- `TransactionModel.swift`: Added tag relationship and convenience methods

The foundation for tag persistence is now complete and ready for service layer implementation!
