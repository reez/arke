# Testing Checklist: Security/Device Separation

## Quick Test Guide

After implementing the separation of security operations from device management, follow this checklist to verify everything works correctly.

---

## 🔍 What Changed?

- `SecurityService` no longer calls `DeviceRegistrationService`
- `MainView` now coordinates device registration
- Device registration happens AFTER `ServiceContainer.configureServices()`

---

## ✅ Pre-Test Verification

### 1. Code Compilation
- [ ] Project builds without errors
- [ ] No compiler warnings about `DeviceRegistrationService` ambiguity
- [ ] No SwiftData-related errors in SecurityService

### 2. Quick Code Review
- [ ] `SecurityService.swift` has no `deviceRegistrationService` references
- [ ] `MainView_iOS.swift` has `registerDeviceIfNeeded()` method
- [ ] `DeviceRegistrationService.swift` has lazy registration pattern

## 🧪 Flow Testing

### Flow 1: New Wallet Creation ✨

**Purpose:** Verify wallet creation from scratch works and device gets registered

**Steps:**
1. Delete app from device completely (long press → delete)
2. Reinstall and launch app
3. Tap "Create new wallet"
4. Complete wallet creation flow
5. Verify wallet view appears

**Expected Logs (in order):**
```
🔍 [SecurityService.static] Keychain mnemonic check: ⚠️ Not found
⏭️ [MainView] No wallet hash available for device registration
✅ [SecurityService] Mnemonic saved to keychain and hash saved to ubiquitous store
   ℹ️  Coordinator should call DeviceRegistrationService.registerCurrentDevice() next
✅ [MainView] Device registered with hasSeed=true
✅ [DeviceRegistrationService] Registered current device
```

**Verification:**
- [ ] Wallet view appears
- [ ] No crashes or errors
- [ ] Device registration log appears AFTER mnemonic saved
- [ ] Device appears in device list (if UI available)

**Common Issues:**
- ❌ If "No wallet hash available": Check that hash is saved to ubiquitous store
- ❌ If device registration fails: Check that ModelContext was configured first

### Flow 2: Device Linking 🔗

**Purpose:** Verify linking wallet from another device works

**Prerequisites:**
- Device A has existing wallet with recovery phrase

**Steps on Device B:**
1. Delete app completely
2. Reinstall and launch app
3. Wait for "Link existing wallet" option to appear (may take 10-30 seconds for iCloud sync)
4. Tap "Link existing wallet"
5. Scan QR code from Device A
6. Complete linking flow
7. Verify wallet view appears with synced data

**Expected Logs (Device B, in order):**
```
🔍 [SecurityService.static] Keychain mnemonic check: ⚠️ Not found
✅ [SecurityService] Retrieved hash from NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore
⚠️ Wallet found on another device, but no seed locally
✅ [MainView] Device registered with hasSeed=false
✅ [SecurityService] Seed imported - coordinator should update device registration
✅ [MainView] Device registered with hasSeed=true
✅ [DeviceRegistrationService] Updated existing device registration
```

**Verification:**
- [ ] "Link wallet" option appears (may take time for iCloud sync)
- [ ] QR scan works
- [ ] Wallet view appears
- [ ] Device registered TWICE (first hasSeed=false, then hasSeed=true)
- [ ] Transactions sync from Device A
- [ ] Both devices appear in device list

**Common Issues:**
- ❌ If link option doesn't appear: Wait longer for iCloud KVS sync (can take minutes)
- ❌ If second registration doesn't happen: Check onWalletReady callback

---

### Flow 3: Existing Wallet (Fast Path) ⚡

**Purpose:** Verify returning user experience is still fast

**Prerequisites:**
- Device already has wallet

**Steps:**
1. Force quit app
2. Launch app
3. Observe startup time
4. Verify wallet view appears quickly

**Expected Logs (in order):**
```
🔍 [SecurityService.static] Keychain mnemonic check: ✅ Found
✅ Using cached wallet detection result: wallet exists
✅ [MainView] Device registered with hasSeed=true
🔧 [MainView_iOS] Initializing wallet in detached background task...
✅ [MainView_iOS] Wallet initialization complete
```

**Verification:**
- [ ] Wallet view appears in < 500ms
- [ ] No redundant wallet detection
- [ ] Device registration happens quickly
- [ ] Heartbeat updates (check device list timestamp)

**Performance Target:**
- App launch to UI: < 300ms
- Total initialization: < 3s

**Common Issues:**
- ❌ If slow: Check if detectWalletState is being called (shouldn't be)
- ❌ If device not registered: Check fast path code in checkForExistingWallet

## 🔍 Log Monitoring Guide

### Logs You SHOULD See

**SecurityService (no registration):**
```
✅ [SecurityService] Mnemonic saved to keychain and hash saved to ubiquitous store
   ℹ️  Coordinator should call DeviceRegistrationService.registerCurrentDevice() next
```

**MainView (handles registration):**
```
✅ [MainView] Device registered with hasSeed=true
```
or
```
✅ [MainView] Device registered with hasSeed=false
```

**DeviceRegistrationService (confirms registration):**
```
✅ [DeviceRegistrationService] Registered current device
```
or
```
✅ [DeviceRegistrationService] Updated existing device registration
```

### Logs You Should NOT See

**❌ In SecurityService:**
```
✅ [SecurityService] Device registered with hasSeed=true
⚠️ [SecurityService] Failed to register device
```

If you see these, the old code is still running!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Compiler Error about DeviceRegistrationService

**Symptoms:**
- Build fails with "DeviceRegistrationService is ambiguous for type lookup"

**Solution:**
- Clean build folder (Cmd+Shift+K)
- Restart Xcode
- Verify SecurityService.swift has no `deviceRegistrationService` references

---

### Issue: Device Not Registered

**Symptoms:**
- Wallet works but device doesn't appear in registry
- Logs show: `⏭️ [MainView] No wallet hash available for device registration`

**Possible Causes:**
1. Hash not saved to ubiquitous store
2. ModelContext not configured before registration
3. Registration call not happening in coordinator

**Debug Steps:**
1. Check if `saveHashToUbiquitousStore()` was called
2. Verify `ServiceContainer.configureServices()` before `registerDeviceIfNeeded()`
3. Check if `registerDeviceIfNeeded()` is actually called
4. Look for errors in DeviceRegistrationService

---

### Issue: Registration Happens Too Early

**Symptoms:**
- Logs show: `⚠️ [DeviceRegistrationService] No model context available`
- Device registration fails silently

**Solution:**
- Verify registration happens AFTER `ServiceContainer.configureServices()`
- Check initialization sequence in MainView
- Use lazy registration pattern if timing uncertain

---

### Issue: Slow Startup After Changes

**Symptoms:**
- Wallet view takes > 1 second to appear
- More operations happening than before

**Possible Causes:**
1. Registration happening on main thread
2. Not using fast path for existing wallet
3. Redundant wallet detection

**Debug Steps:**
1. Check if `initialWalletDetected` is being used
2. Verify registration is async (shouldn't block UI)
3. Profile app launch time
