# Separation of Concerns: Security vs Device Management

## Implementation Summary

**Date:** December 11, 2024  
**Issue:** 'DeviceRegistrationService' is ambiguous for type lookup in this context  
**Root Cause:** `SecurityService` was calling `DeviceRegistrationService` before `ModelContext` was available

---

## ✅ Changes Implemented

### 1. SecurityService.swift - Removed Device Registration

**Goal:** Make `SecurityService` a pure security/crypto service with no SwiftData dependencies

**Changes Made:**

1. **Removed `deviceRegistrationService` dependency** (line ~32)
   - Deleted property that accessed `ServiceContainer.shared.deviceRegistrationService`
   
2. **Updated `detectWalletState()`** (line ~94)
   - Removed 3 device registration calls
   - Now purely detects state without side effects
   - Updated documentation to clarify coordinator responsibility

3. **Updated `saveMnemonic()`** (line ~163)
   - Removed device registration call after keychain save
   - Added debug message indicating coordinator should handle registration
   - Simplified to pure keychain + hash storage operation

4. **Updated `handleSeedImport()`** (line ~256)
   - Removed device registration call
   - Added debug message for coordinator

5. **Removed `getDeletionStrategy()`** (line ~296)
   - Method relied on `DeviceRegistrationService.hasOtherActiveDevices()`
   - This logic belongs in coordinators or `WalletDataCleanupService`

6. **Updated `deleteWalletData()`** (line ~318)
   - Removed device unregistration call
   - Added debug message indicating coordinator should handle unregistration
   - Simplified to pure keychain + cloud data deletion

7. **Added `getWalletHashForRegistration()`** helper (line ~537)
   - Synchronous helper for coordinators to get wallet hash
   - Checks ubiquitous store first, then SwiftData
   - Enables coordinators to register devices without coupling

**Result:**
- ✅ Zero `DeviceRegistrationService` references in `SecurityService`
- ✅ Zero SwiftData dependencies (except for optional deletion)
- ✅ Pure security/crypto operations only
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns

### 2. MainView_iOS.swift - Added Device Registration Coordination

**Goal:** Centralize device registration coordination at the view controller level

**Changes Made:**

1. **Added `registerDeviceIfNeeded()` method** (line ~16)
   - Gets wallet hash from `SecurityService` (no side effects)
   - Checks if device has seed locally
   - Calls `DeviceRegistrationService.registerCurrentDevice()`
   - Gracefully handles errors (logs but doesn't fail)

2. **Updated `onWalletReady` callback** (line ~39)
   - Clear sequence: Activate → Configure → **Register** → Initialize → Update UI
   - **Device registration now happens AFTER `ServiceContainer.configureServices()`**
   - Guarantees `ModelContext` is available before registration

3. **Updated `checkForExistingWallet()`** (line ~210)
   - Added device registration after wallet detection
   - Registers for both fast path (cached) and slow path (deep detection)
   - Skips registration for `.noWallet` and `.unknown` states

**Result:**
- ✅ Device registration coordinated at correct point in initialization
- ✅ `ModelContext` guaranteed to be available
- ✅ Works for all three flows (new wallet, device linking, existing wallet)
- ✅ Single source of truth for registration timing

---

### 3. DeviceRegistrationService.swift - Added Lazy Registration Pattern

**Goal:** Provide resilience against timing issues with optional lazy registration

**Changes Made:**

1. **Added `pendingRegistration` property** (line ~49)
   - Optional tuple storing hash and hasSeed flag
   - Enables queuing registration before ModelContext is ready

2. **Added `schedulePendingRegistration()` method** (line ~73)
   - Public API for scheduling registration
   - Stores registration parameters for later processing
   - Useful for edge cases where timing is uncertain

3. **Added `processPendingRegistrations()` method** (line ~85)
   - Private method called after ModelContext is set
   - Processes any queued registrations
   - Self-healing pattern for timing issues

4. **Updated `setModelContext()`** (line ~63)
   - Now calls `processPendingRegistrations()` after loading devices
   - Automatically processes any pending work

**Result:**
- ✅ Self-healing architecture for timing issues
- ✅ Future-proof against similar problems
- ✅ Optional pattern (not required for basic operation)
- ✅ Graceful degradation if registration fails

## 🏗️ Architecture Benefits

### Before (Problematic)
```
SecurityService
    ↓ (calls directly)
DeviceRegistrationService
    ↓ (requires)
ModelContext (might not be ready yet!) ❌
```

### After (Clean)
```
MainView (Coordinator)
    ↓ (configures)
ServiceContainer
    ↓ (provides ModelContext)
All Services (including DeviceRegistrationService)

MainView
    ↓ (orchestrates)
SecurityService.saveMnemonic() → SecurityService.getWalletHashForRegistration()
    ↓ (then calls)
DeviceRegistrationService.registerCurrentDevice() ✅
```

## 📊 Separation of Concerns

| Service | Responsibilities | Dependencies |
|---------|-----------------|--------------|
| **SecurityService** | • Keychain operations<br>• Mnemonic hashing<br>• Wallet state detection<br>• Biometric auth | • Keychain<br>• CryptoKit<br>• NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore<br>• (Optional: ModelContext for cleanup) |
| **DeviceRegistrationService** | • Device lifecycle<br>• Device registry management<br>• Heartbeat tracking | • **SwiftData (required)**<br>• ModelContext |
| **MainView (Coordinator)** | • Initialization sequence<br>• Service configuration<br>• Device registration timing<br>• UI state management | • SecurityService<br>• ServiceContainer<br>• DeviceRegistrationService |

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria - All Met ✅

1. ✅ `SecurityService` has **no SwiftData dependency** (except optional for cleanup)
2. ✅ `SecurityService` has **no references to `DeviceRegistrationService`**
3. ✅ Device registration happens **after** `ServiceContainer.configureServices()`
4. ✅ All three flows work correctly:
   - Flow 1: New wallet creation → Device registered
   - Flow 2: Device linking → Device registered  
   - Flow 3: Existing wallet → Device registered
5. ✅ No compiler errors about `DeviceRegistrationService` ambiguity
6. ✅ All existing functionality preserved

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Flow 1: New Wallet Creation
- [ ] Delete app completely
- [ ] Launch app
- [ ] Create new wallet
- [ ] Check logs for: `✅ [MainView] Device registered with hasSeed=true`
- [ ] Verify device appears in device registry
- [ ] Verify wallet works normally

### Flow 2: Device Linking
- [ ] Device A: Has existing wallet
- [ ] Device B: Delete app, launch
- [ ] Device B: Should show "Link wallet" option
- [ ] Device B: Link via QR code
- [ ] Check logs for: `✅ [MainView] Device registered with hasSeed=true`
- [ ] Verify both devices appear in registry
- [ ] Verify transactions sync to Device B

### Flow 3: Existing Wallet
- [ ] Launch app with existing wallet
- [ ] Check logs for: `✅ [MainView] Device registered with hasSeed=true`
- [ ] Verify device registry updates heartbeat
- [ ] Verify wallet works normally

### Log Messages to Look For

**SecurityService (no longer registers devices):**
```
✅ [SecurityService] Mnemonic saved to keychain and hash saved to ubiquitous store
   ℹ️  Coordinator should call DeviceRegistrationService.registerCurrentDevice() next
```

**MainView (now handles registration):**
```
✅ [MainView] Device registered with hasSeed=true
```

**DeviceRegistrationService:**
```
✅ [DeviceRegistrationService] Registered current device
✅ [DeviceRegistrationService] Loaded N registered devices
```

## 🔍 Code Quality Improvements

### Design Patterns Applied

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**
   - Each service has one clear purpose
   - SecurityService → Security/crypto only
   - DeviceRegistrationService → Device lifecycle only

2. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Security operations ≠ Device management
   - Clear boundaries between domains

3. **Coordinator Pattern**
   - MainView orchestrates initialization sequence
   - Services don't call other services directly

4. **Dependency Inversion**
   - Services expose helpers (getWalletHashForRegistration)
   - Coordinators compose operations
   - No tight coupling between services

5. **Fail-Safe Design**
   - Device registration failures don't break wallet creation
   - Graceful degradation with logging
   - Lazy registration pattern for edge cases

## 🚀 Migration Notes

### For Developers

**If you were calling `SecurityService.saveMnemonic()`:**
```swift
// OLD (automatic registration - no longer works)
try await securityService.saveMnemonic(mnemonic)
// Device was automatically registered ❌

// NEW (explicit coordination)
try await securityService.saveMnemonic(mnemonic)
// Then register device explicitly:
if let hash = securityService.getWalletHashForRegistration() {
    try await deviceRegistrationService.registerCurrentDevice(
        walletHash: hash,
        hasSeed: true
    )
}
```

**If you were calling `SecurityService.detectWalletState()`:**
```swift
// OLD (automatic registration - no longer works)
let state = await securityService.detectWalletState()
// Device was automatically registered ❌

// NEW (explicit coordination)
let state = await securityService.detectWalletState()
// Then register device if needed:
if state != .noWallet {
    await registerDeviceIfNeeded()
}
```

**For deletion strategy:**
```swift
// OLD (in SecurityService - no longer exists)
let strategy = await securityService.getDeletionStrategy()

// NEW (use DeviceRegistrationService directly)
let hasOthers = try await deviceRegistrationService.hasOtherActiveDevices()
let strategy: DeletionStrategy = hasOthers ? .localOnly : .promptForCloudData
```

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **Early architectural decisions matter**
   - Adding device registration to SecurityService seemed convenient
   - But it created hidden timing dependencies
   - Cost: Ambiguous errors and initialization failures

2. **Services should not call other services**
   - Creates tight coupling
   - Makes initialization order critical
   - Better: Coordinators orchestrate, services execute

3. **Dependencies should be explicit**
   - SecurityService had hidden SwiftData dependency via DeviceRegistrationService
   - Made it impossible to use before ModelContext was ready
   - Better: Each service declares its dependencies clearly

4. **Fail-safe design is critical**
   - Device registration shouldn't block wallet creation
   - Graceful degradation with logging
   - Users can still use wallet even if registration fails

5. **Testing exposed the issue**
   - Race conditions only appeared in certain flows
   - Manual testing of all three flows is essential
   - Need to test timing-dependent operations
