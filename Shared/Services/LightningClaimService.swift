/// Service responsible for automatically claiming pending Lightning receives in the background
/// 
/// This service runs a timer that periodically checks for pending Lightning receives and
/// automatically claims them. Once claimed, the Bark SDK creates Movement events which
/// trigger WalletNotificationService notifications, causing transactions to appear in the UI.
///
/// Lightning Receive Flow:
/// 1. User generates Lightning invoice
/// 2. External user pays the invoice → Payment sits in "pending" state
/// 3. Service detects pending receive (hasHtlcVtxos && !preimageRevealed)
/// 4. Service auto-claims → SDK creates Movement → Notification fires → Transaction appears
///
/// Design:
/// - Foreground only: Pauses when app goes to background
/// - Timer-based: Checks every 30 seconds (fast response for incoming payments)
/// - SDK-driven: No complex state tracking, just polls SDK
/// - Silent failures: Logs errors but doesn't interrupt user
/// - Debounced: Prevents overlapping claims with isClaiming flag
